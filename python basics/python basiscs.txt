Bitwise Operators
-----------------

Bitwise operators work on individual bits not on number as a whole

1. | (bitwise or)  (Disjunction)
2. & (bitwise and) (Conjunction)
3. ~ (bitwise negation) (Negation)
4. ^  (bitwise exclusive) (Exclusive)  : True is exactly one bit is 1 , even if both bit is 1 then result becomes false : 1^0 , 0^1 == 1 but 1^1 is 0
4. >> (binary right shift operator)
5. << (binary left shift operator)

Note:
Some important quick info regarding about binary shift operations

1.) 22 >>1 is same as 22//2   ==> Right shift by 1 bit is dividing by 2
2.) 22 >> 2 is same as 22//4  ==> Right shift by 1 bit is dividing by 4
3.) 22 << 1 is same as 22*2 ==> Left Shift operator by 1  means multiply by 2
4.) 22 << 2 is same as 22*4 ==>  Left Shift operator by 2 bits  means multiply by 4
